# üö® EDIT FUNCTIONALITY ISSUES IDENTIFIED

## üéØ **PROBLEM SUMMARY**

During the modular architecture conversion, the edit functionality for **Reservations** and **Roles** pages was broken. The edit buttons do not open modals and show "Error loading data".

## üîç **ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### **‚úÖ Working Pages:**
- **Vehicles** - Edit modals work perfectly
- **Customers** - Edit modals work perfectly  
- **Maintenance** - Edit modals work perfectly
- **Users** - Edit modals work perfectly

### **‚ùå Broken Pages:**
- **Reservations** - Edit button does nothing, no modal opens
- **Roles** - Edit button does nothing, no modal opens

## üîß **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

The issue appears to be that during the modular extraction:

1. **AJAX Endpoints Missing**: The JavaScript functions for `editReservation()` and `editRole()` are likely not properly connected to the AJAX endpoints
2. **Modal HTML Missing**: The modal HTML for reservations and roles may not be included in the modular pages
3. **JavaScript Functions**: The edit functions may not be properly defined or accessible

## üìã **SPECIFIC SYMPTOMS**

### **Reservations Page:**
- Edit button exists but clicking does nothing
- No modal appears
- No JavaScript errors visible (need to check console)
- AJAX call likely failing silently

### **Roles Page:**
- Edit button exists but clicking does nothing  
- No modal appears
- No JavaScript errors visible (need to check console)
- AJAX call likely failing silently

## üõ†Ô∏è **REQUIRED FIXES**

### **1. Check AJAX Endpoints**
- Verify `get_reservation` and `get_role` endpoints exist in main PHP file
- Ensure proper case handling in switch statement

### **2. Verify Modal HTML**
- Check if edit modals are included in reservations.php and roles.php
- Ensure modal IDs match JavaScript function calls

### **3. JavaScript Functions**
- Verify `editReservation()` and `editRole()` functions are defined
- Check if functions are properly calling AJAX endpoints

### **4. Database Queries**
- Ensure database queries for fetching reservation and role data are correct
- Verify field names match database schema

## üéØ **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Examine Code**: Check the modular files for missing components
2. **Fix AJAX Endpoints**: Add missing endpoints to main PHP file
3. **Add Modal HTML**: Ensure modals are included in page files
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify fixes work on production server
5. **Commit Changes**: Update repository with fixes

## üìä **IMPACT**

- **High Priority**: Edit functionality is core business feature
- **User Experience**: Broken functionality affects daily operations
- **Data Integrity**: Users cannot modify reservations or roles
- **System Completeness**: Reduces overall system functionality
